#Cassava Leaf Disease Classification using EfficientNetB3

##Overview

This project applies deep learning and image classification techniques to detect different types of cassava leaf diseases from plant images.
By leveraging transfer learning with EfficientNetB3, the model aims to accurately classify infected and healthy leaves — assisting farmers in early disease detection and yield improvement.

##Objective

To build a robust image classification model capable of identifying cassava leaf diseases from images using pretrained CNN architectures and data augmentation techniques.

##Problem Statement

Cassava is a key food crop across tropical regions, but its yield is threatened by various leaf diseases. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and error-prone.
This project addresses the question:

>“Can a deep learning model accurately classify cassava leaf diseases from images to support early detection and precision agriculture?”

##Data Preparation & Augmentation

Read and mapped image labels using label_num_to_disease_map.json

Visualized sample images from each class

Handled class imbalance by stratified sampling

Applied ImageDataGenerator for:

Random rotations (up to 60°)

Width & height shifts

Shearing and zooming

Horizontal & vertical flips

EfficientNet preprocessing for normalization

Model Architecture

Base Model: EfficientNetB3 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Global Average Pooling and Flatten layers

Dense layers with ReLU activation and L1/L2 regularization

Dropout (0.7) to prevent overfitting

Output Layer: Softmax activation (5 classes)

Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 2e-4)
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy with label smoothing
Metrics: Categorical Accuracy

Training Strategy

Callbacks Used:

EarlyStopping – stop training if no improvement in validation loss

ModelCheckpoint – save best model automatically

ReduceLROnPlateau – lower learning rate on validation loss plateau

Epochs: 5 (initial), fine-tuned for additional 3 epochs

Batch Size: 32

Validation Split: 5–10%

Model Evaluation

Plotted Training vs. Validation Accuracy and Loss Curves

Observed stable convergence after fine-tuning with new data

Best performing model: Cassava_best_modelEffNetB3v3.h5

Predictions

Loaded trained model for inference on unseen test images

Resized test images to (300, 300)

Predicted disease class using model’s softmax output

Key Insights

Transfer learning using EfficientNetB3 achieved strong generalization on plant leaf datasets.

Data augmentation helped reduce overfitting on limited samples.

Model effectively distinguishes healthy leaves from multiple disease types.

Business Implications

Enables AI-driven crop disease detection, reducing manual diagnosis time.

Can be integrated into mobile apps or agriculture advisory tools.

Supports farmers and agricultural scientists in early disease management and yield protection.
